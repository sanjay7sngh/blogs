Hi, and welcome to my page!

Thank you for stopping by. This site serves as a space where I document my learning journey, which helps me reflect and reinforce my knowledge. I hope that what I share here is also helpful to others.

Iâ€™m passionate about plant genomics, particularly in areas like variant calling from high-throughput sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics, germplasm core selection, and screening cultivars and genes for abiotic and biotic stress traits.
