<span style="color:blue;">**This will be a long comprehensive article. I will update it soon.**</span>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #ff0000; background-color: #f0f0f0;">I am going to write here in brief how to perform both denovo and reference based rnaseq analysis. I will try to include lncRNA analysis in this article.</p> 

Meanwhile this pipeline can be foollowed:

Gene level expression analysis: [Expression-Analysis-pipeline](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.095)

lncRNA identification and classification: [Plant-LncRNA-pipeline](https://github.com/xuechantian/Plant-LncRNA-pipline)


<span style="color:#ff0000;">Stay tuned...</span>
