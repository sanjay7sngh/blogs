In this article, I will add definitions of commonly encountered term in sequence data analysis.

***

### Read: 
Single sequence produced after sequencing as machine reads the a nucleotide fragment.

***

### Sequencing by synthesis: 
 An approach of sequencing where individual nucleotides are added to a growing DNA or RNA strand one at a time, and the incorporation of each nucleotide is detected by fluorescence or other means. Ex: Illumina
 
***

### Gene: 


***

### Genome: 


***

### Genomics: 

***

### Transcriptomics: 

***
### Broad Sense Heritability:
Ratio of total genetic variance to phenotypic variance

***

### Narrow Sense Heritability:
Ratio ofadditive genetic variance to phenotypic variance

***

### Phenotypic Variance:
Total variance among phenotypes when grown over the range of environments of interest to the breeder.

***

### Total Genetic Variance:
The part of the phenotypic variance which can be attributed to genotypic differences among the phenotypes. Can be futher subdevided into additive, dominant and epistatic variance.

***

### Genotype-environment Interaction Variance:
Part of the phenotypic variance attributable to the failure of differences between genotypes to be the same in different environments.
