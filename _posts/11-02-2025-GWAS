Comparing different GWAS models based on key criteria:  

| **Model**   | **Single-Locus or Multi-Locus** | **Accounts for Population Structure (PCA/Q-matrix)?** | **Accounts for Kinship (K-matrix)?** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** | **Best Use Case** |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **GLM (General Linear Model)** | **Single-Locus** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Simple, fast, suitable for small datasets | High false positives due to lack of structure correction | Traits with strong associations, no complex population structure |
| **MLM (Mixed Linear Model)** | **Single-Locus** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Corrects population structure and relatedness | Computationally slow for large datasets | Traits influenced by genetic background (structured populations) |
| **CMLM (Compressed MLM)** | **Single-Locus** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Faster than MLM, efficient for large datasets | May lose statistical power if compression is too high | Large datasets with structured populations |
| **MLMM (Multi-Locus Mixed Model)** | **Multi-Locus** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Handles polygenic traits by including multiple SNPs | More complex computation, needs tuning | Traits controlled by multiple loci |
| **FarmCPU (Fixed and Random Model Circulating Probability Unification)** | **Multi-Locus** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Reduces confounding, high power, efficient for large datasets | Can be sensitive to model parameter tuning | Large datasets, polygenic traits with complex inheritance |
| **BLINK (Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway)** | **Multi-Locus** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Faster than FarmCPU, high statistical power | May overcorrect, leading to false negatives | Fast GWAS with high accuracy in large datasets |

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Single-locus models** (GLM, MLM, CMLM) are good for detecting **major effect loci** but may miss **polygenic effects**.  
- **Multi-locus models** (MLMM, FarmCPU, BLINK) **improve detection power** for polygenic traits but require careful tuning.  
- **FarmCPU and BLINK** are among the most **powerful and efficient models** for large-scale GWAS.
