<span style="color:blue;">**We will define here cultivar, variety, landrace etc.**</span>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #ff0000; background-color: #f0f0f0;">Will update this; goal of this article is define subcategory of species and will include the concept of gene pool.</p>

### **1. Species**
- **Definition**: A group of organisms that share common characteristics and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring.  
- **Example**: *Oryza sativa* (rice), *Gossypium hirsutum* (upland cotton).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Natural biological classification.  
  - Contains genetic variation within populations.  

---

### **2. Landrace**
- **Definition**: A locally adapted, traditional variety that evolves in specific environments without formal breeding.  
- **Example**: Local wheat varieties like "Khangri" in India or heirloom maize varieties in Mexico.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - High genetic diversity.  
  - Suited to specific regions and farming practices.  
  - Often selected by farmers for resilience and yield stability.

---

### **3. Cultivar**  
- **Definition**: A plant variety developed and maintained through human intervention for desirable traits.  
- **Example**: IR64 (rice), Gala apple.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Uniform and stable in traits.  
  - Often legally registered and protected.  
  - Requires human propagation methods.  

---

### **4. Cultigen**  
- **Definition**: A plant that has been domesticated, altered, or bred by humans.  
- **Example**: Modern maize (*Zea mays*), which originated from wild teosinte.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Includes both landraces and cultivars.  
  - Developed through selection or breeding.  

---

### **5. Germplasm**  
- **Definition**: The genetic material (seeds, tissue, or DNA) used for breeding and conservation.  
- **Example**: Wild rice stored in gene banks for future breeding programs.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - A reservoir of genetic diversity.  
  - Essential for breeding improved varieties.  

---

### **6. Variety**
- **Definition**: A subtype of a species with distinct characteristics, either naturally occurring or bred.  
- **Example**: Basmati rice (*Oryza sativa var. indica*).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Broader term encompassing landraces and cultivars.  
  - May be registered or naturally existing.  

---

### **7. Accession**
- **Definition**: A specific sample or population of germplasm collected and stored for conservation or research.  
- **Example**: A specific seed lot of *Oryza sativa* from a gene bank.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Unique identifier assigned during storage.  
  - Represents a genetic resource for breeding.  

---

### **8. Ecotype**  
- **Definition**: A genetically distinct population of a species adapted to a specific environmental condition.  
- **Example**: Alpine ecotypes of *Arabidopsis thaliana*.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Adapted to specific habitats.  
  - Shows variations due to environmental pressures.  

---

### **9. Strain**  
- **Definition**: A genetic subgroup or population within a species, often used for microorganisms, but also for plants.  
- **Example**: A bacterial strain used in plant disease research or specific breeding strains of wheat.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Genetically uniform group.  
  - Often used in research or breeding programs.  

---

### **10. Line**  
- **Definition**: A group of plants bred to have a consistent genetic background, often used in breeding programs.  
- **Example**: RILs (Recombinant Inbred Lines) in genetic studies.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Genetically stable.  
  - Used for experiments and breeding.  

---

### **11. Clone**  
- **Definition**: Genetically identical individuals derived from a single parent through vegetative propagation.  
- **Example**: Clonal propagation of sugarcane or bananas.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Uniform traits across all individuals.  
  - Maintained without sexual reproduction.  

---

### **12. Hybrid**  
- **Definition**: Offspring resulting from the crossing of two genetically distinct parents, typically from different varieties or species.  
- **Example**: Hybrid maize (*Zea mays*), Triticale (wheat-rye hybrid).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Exhibits hybrid vigor (heterosis).  
  - Sterility or reduced fertility is common in interspecific hybrids.
